This is a small collection of hints for MAC users who 
are about to install couchapp and have some problems.

I am running an MAC OS X 10.5.6

#1 Problems with easy_install
-----------------------------

Actually I had an error message while doing this:

$ easy_install couchapp
[...]
The required version of setuptools (>=0.6c9) is not available, and
can't be installed while this script is running. Please install
 a more recent version first, using 'easy_install -U setuptools'.

(Currently using setuptools 0.6c7 (/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Extras/lib/python))
error: Setup script exited with 2

To avoid this, you have to install a newer version of the setuptools. Simply type

$ sudo easy_install -U setuptools
Searching for setuptools
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple/setuptools/
Best match: setuptools 0.6c9
Processing setuptools-0.6c9-py2.5.egg
setuptools 0.6c9 is already the active version in easy-install.pth
Installing easy_install script to /usr/local/bin
Installing easy_install-2.5 script to /usr/local/bin

Using /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/setuptools-0.6c9-py2.5.egg
Processing dependencies for setuptools

After having the newer version and repeating the first cmd, the error
still occures. That's because you have to use the path /usr/local/bin

$ sudo /usr/local/bin/easy_install couchapp

Now everything works fine.
